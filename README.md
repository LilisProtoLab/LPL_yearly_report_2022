# Lili's Proto Lab Yearly Report

This LaTeX project serves as our first installment of our yearly report. 
Here, we can document all new developments, member stories, and projects that have accumulated over the year.

By typesetting the report in LaTeX, we will have a unified and easy to replicate design for the future.
The overall design is inspired by the yearly reports of the [Institute of Making](https://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/about), London.

## Using custom command for the section title
Every section starts with a double page and a preformatted section title. 
To simply create a new section, use the `\LPLsection{<TITLE>}` command.
